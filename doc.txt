About the game:

There are three main entities:
Surgeons.
Nurses.
Patients.

Patients have a number of features that may dictate how high a priority their surgery is. Each nurse has a priority queue of all the patients in the hospital needing surgery, sorted on a different key. The dr. starts with patient zero and will only perform the surgery if he has enough nurses (4?).
The timer starts at t = 0. The patient lives until some t = n, predefined. 
At each time step:
  i. nurses pop a patient off of their prioirty queue and go to that patient. If it is the correct patient, the nurse stays there.
 if there are enough nurses, heal the patient, remove patient from primary container, reset nurse queues, move dr. to next patient and reset timer.
 else advance the timer one step, check whether or not the patient is alive: If patient is dead, remove patient from primary container, move dr. reset the nurses queues, reset timer.
end when there are no more patients.
