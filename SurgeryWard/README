The purpose of this code is to showcase my knowledge of various aspects of the C++ language.
The language features I use are:
(X) operator overloading
(X) Classes
(X) Inherited Classes
(X) Abstract Classes
( ) Smart Pointers
(X) Interacting with a SQLite DB
(X) Priority Queue
(X) Templates
(X) Map
(X) Vector
( ) Function Pointer
( ) SDL
( ) Valgrind For Memory Validating
( ) Error Handling
( ) Dynamically Allocating Memory


# TODO:
- If possible, put all sdl functions in another file. I don't yet understand why the window and renderer are declared outside of the functions which use them.
- write whether or not a patient lived into the db. 

Done:
operator overloading : overloading the << operator for nurses, patients.
classes : several classes
inherited classes : person -> nurse -> nurseXX
                    person -> patient
                    person -> doctor
abstract class : person
sqldb : use sqlite to get patient, nurse info.
priority queue : each nurse stores a priority queue of patients and pops one off, deciding where the nurse should go.
templates : the print_vector function is templated to print out the contents of arbitray vectors. Of course, the range based loop with auto would also work.
map: map storing the disease information
vector: all patients and nurses are stored in vectors.
